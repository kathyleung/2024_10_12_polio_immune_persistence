Please run the codes following the below order:

1) main_polio_threshold_var.R: This file contains the code for performing statistical inference in a Bayesian framework with noninformative (flat) priors using Markov Chain Monte Carlo with Gibbs sampling. 

2) main_polio_plot_threshold_var.m: This file contains the code for estimating the distribution of mean titre and seroprotection proportion over time, and generating Figure S3.
