The codes in the folder "sensitivity_analysis_sample_size" are for sensitivity analysis on sample size and generating Figure S2.

Please run the codes following the below order:

1) main_polio_sample_size_var.R: This file contains the code for performing statistical inference in a Bayesian framework with noninformative (flat) priors using Markov Chain Monte Carlo with Gibbs sampling under different sample sizes. 

2) main_polio_plot_sample_size_var.m: This file contains the code for estimating the distribution of mean titre and seroprotection proportion over time, and generating Figure S2.
